This README contains information about configuration of taprio Qdisc
For now based only on TI k4.19 branch and patches backported from mainline.

Patches to be applied on TI k4.19, branch is here:
https://github.com/ikhorn/ti_taprio/commits/taprio_tik4.19

Counter part patches to be applied on iproute, branch is here:
https://github.com/ikhorn/iproute2/commits/backported_taprio_changes

1) Example for sw configuration:

tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent root handle 100 taprio \
        num_tc 3 \
        map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \
        queues 1@0 1@1 2@2 \
        base-time 10000000 \
        sched-entry S 03 300000 \
        sched-entry S 02 300000 \
        sched-entry S 06 400000 \
	clockid CLOCK_TAI \

2) Example for h/w configuration of taprio Qdisc:

tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent root handle 100 taprio \
        num_tc 3 \
        map 2 2 1 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \
        queues 1@0 1@1 2@2 \
        base-time 10000000 \
        sched-entry S 03 300000 \
        sched-entry S 02 300000 \
        sched-entry S 06 400000 \
        offload 1\
        clockid CLOCK_TAI \

3) To send traffic to appropriate queue, you need prio socket option to be set.
I'm using plget, that actually has all needed infrastructure
